### Q: Can I get banned by using this script?

**A:** I've tried getting in contact with Lilith through various means, and until this day I did **not** get an answer from them. Their [Terms of Service](https://www.lilithgames.com/termofservice.html) states the following:

> You agree not to do any of the following while using our Services, Lilith Content, or User Content: [...] Use cheats, exploits, hacks, bots, mods or third party software designed to gain an advantage, perceived or actual, over other Members, or modify or interfere with the Service; [...]

In my opinion, this does **not** include this script, as players don't gain any type of advantage over other players. Maybe time in their life, but that's about it... I can also let you know there's a really low chance for Lilith to find out you're using this script, unless they actively try to search for it. And I doubt they're willing to spend resources into that.

Though Lilith has confirmed, that using Bluestacks macros is allowed in the game. This makes me believe this script is also allowed.

Do with this information what you want. I'm *not responsible at all* if anything happens to your account. **Use at your own risk.**

### Q: Will this ever be available on iOS?

**A:** Nope. Install Bluestacks and run this script.
