The script is developed in a way to exit whenever something doesn't go as planned. In case it does *not* exit though, it's either still OK and you'll have to correct it yourself after it's finished, or (in very rare occasions) it just straight up breaks stuff. I have never had someone "call me" while the script was running for example, so I have no idea what would happen there...

Either way, if something doesn't go as planned, be sure to hit `Control+C` in the terminal to stop the script from executing!
