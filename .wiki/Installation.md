**For advanced users:**

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
2. Connect your device to the computer (or start your emulator of choice).
3. Run `./deploy.sh` to generate [`config.ini`](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Config) and change its values if necessary.
4. Check the [[usage]] page on how to run the script (or run `./deploy.sh` again).
5. Watch your device magically play for you. It's fun! I promise.

**For normal users:**

1. Create a folder on your machine to save this script in
2. Open up a terminal at said directory:
   - **Windows:** Open the directory, `Shift+Right Mouse Click` inside it, and click on `Git Bash here`.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open a terminal, and `cd` into your directory.
3. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily.git` in the terminal.
4. Run `cd AFK-Daily` in the terminal.
5. Connect your device to the computer (or start your emulator of choice).
6. Type `./deploy.sh` into your terminal.
7. Configure [`config.ini`](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Config) if necessary.
8. Check the [[usage]] page on how to run the script.
9. Watch your device magically play for you. It's fun! I promise.

**If for whatever reason `git clone https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily.git` (step 3) returns an error**, simply download this repository as a `.zip` file by clicking [here](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), and unzip it into your directory. Then open the "AFK-Daily-master" folder, open a terminal there (step 2) and follow the rest of the steps starting at step 5. Keep in mind automatic updates won't be working then. [Send me a message](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Troubleshooting), I'd be happy to help!
