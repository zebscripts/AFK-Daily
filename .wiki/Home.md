## Tips

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- Don't try to run the script with more than one device connected
- Whenever something happens that you don't want to happen, just hit `Control+C` on the terminal and the script will instantly stop! *Note: If you happen to `Ctrl+C` while the script is `sleeping`, the terminal never exits. Please close and reopen it.*
- If for some reason the script returns errors like `: not found[0]: syntax error`, it's probably because `afk-daily.sh` is not saved wth `LF` line endings. Supposedly the script already does the conversion for you, but it appears you'll have to [do it yourself](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/218032857-Converting-from-Windows-style-to-UNIX-style-line-endings). Apologies.
