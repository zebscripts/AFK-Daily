Welcome to the AFK-Daily script wiki!

You'll find everything you need to know in order to get up and running with the script here.

This is still a work in progress, so please be patient.

## About the project

It's basically an auto-completer of the AFK Arena daily tasks. If you easily lose interest in playing a game because you have nothing to do, then we **strongly recommend not using this script**, it'll definitely ruin the fun for you. Otherwise, if you enjoy watching a computer perform tasks for you, you've come to the right place!

The script is capable of various things, [here's a list of all the features](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Features). You can technically also use it solely as a "push campaign" or "push towers" script, more info [here](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Features#push-campaigntowers-only).

## Quickstart

We've created a wiki article explaining how to get started, check it out [here](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Get-started).
