The script has gotten pretty modular lately, and users have a lot of control over which features they want to make use of. Technically speaking, the script could run on a level 1 account though you'd only be able to use like 10% of the features. Just make sure to select the features your account is capable of doing:

- **Mercenaries:** Stage 6-40
- **Quick-battle Guild:** VIP 6 or higher
- **Skip battle in the arena:** VIP 6 or higher
- **Bounty Autofill and Dispatch:** VIP 6 or higher
- **Auto-fill Heroes in quests:** VIP 6 or higher (or stage 12-40)
- **Twisted Realm:** Stage 14-40
- **Factional Towers:** Stage 15-1
