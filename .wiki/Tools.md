Here's a list of tools you need to have/install to be able to run this script:

1. An Android device/emulator
2. Being able to run `.sh` scripts

Do not worry, it's not as complicated as it seems.

Let's start with your Android device/emulator! Check [this wiki page](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Supported-Devices) out for a list of all the devices the script successfully got tested on. Simply pick one. **If you don't know which one, pick Bluestacks.** Navigate to its website to download the emulator and install it.

Next up is being able to run/execute `.sh` files. This shouldn't be a problem for macOS or Linux, *but Windows definitely needs extra software for that*. If you're running Windows, I recommend installing [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), as it's the easiest method in my opinion. I'm also going to assume you installed Git Bash for the rest of the installation.
