Here's a list of tools you need to have/install to be able to run this script:

1. An Android device/emulator
2. Being able to run `.sh` scripts

Do not worry, it's not as complicated as it seems.

Let's start with your Android device/emulator! Check [this wiki page](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Supported-Devices) out for a list of all the devices the script successfully got tested on. Simply pick one. If you don't know which one, pick Bluestacks. After picking one, navigate to its website to download the emulator and install it.

Next up is being able to run/execute `.sh` files. This shouldn't be a problem for macOS or Linux, *but Windows definitely needs extra software for that*. If you're running Windows, I recommend installing [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), as it's the easiest method in my opinion. I'm also going to assume you installed Git Bash for the rest of the installation.
