Please keep the following things in mind:

- Game language needs to be "English"
- Make sure there are no "Don't remind me again" pop-up messages

Also, the script is pretty modular, which means users have a lot of control over which features they want to make use of and which not. Technically speaking, the script could run on a level 1 account, though you'd only be able to use like 10% of the features. A feature is being developed where the script decides on its own which features it is able to run depending on your VIP and Chapter/Stage levels. However, since it's still in development, please take a look at the necessary levels on [this page](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/discussions/124) and decide for yourself what you want to the script to run.
