The script is pretty modular, which means users have a lot of control over which features they want to make use of and which not. Technically speaking, the script could run on a level 1 account, though you'd only be able to use like 10% of the features. Just make sure to select the features your account is capable of doing:

- **Mercenaries:** Stage 6-40
- **Quick-battle Guild:** VIP 6 or higher
- **Skip battle in the arena:** VIP 6 or higher
- **Bounty Autofill and Dispatch:** VIP 6 or higher
- **Auto-fill Heroes in quests:** VIP 6 or higher (or stage 12-40)
- **Twisted Realm:** Stage 14-40
- **Factional Towers:** Stage 15-1

Also, **please make sure to have fought in battles at least once before running the script!** If for example, a new Twisted Realm boss gets released, the game does not know which formation you want to use. Though the script doesn't know this and tries to start the fight regardless, which of course won't work. In case you get into this situation, simply start the fight yourself, and the script should pick up whenever the fight has finished.
