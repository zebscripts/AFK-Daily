## Description

This script is meant to automate the process of daily activities within the [AFK Arena](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilithgame.hgame.gp&hl=en_US) game. It uses [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to analyse pixel colors in screenshots and tap on the screen accordingly. If you like our work, please consider starring this repository (and joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Fq2cfqjp8D)) as it lets us know people use the script, which motivates us to keep working on it!

## Disclaimer

This is a very fragile script (it relies on pixel accuracy), which means the probability of encountering a new error every time a new patch rolls out by Lilith is pretty high. Keep an eye on the `Patch` badge to check the latest game version this script was tested on.

**We are not responsible for any type of ban or unintentional purchase! Use this script at your own risk.** We will do our best to try and make it as robust as possible.

## About the project

It's basically an auto-completer of the AFK Arena daily tasks. If you easily lose interest in playing a game because you have nothing to do, then we **strongly recommend not using this script**, it'll definitely ruin the fun for you. Otherwise, if you enjoy watching a computer perform tasks for you, you've come to the right place!

The script is capable of various things, [here's a list of all the features](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Features). You can technically also use it solely as a "push campaign" or "push towers" script, more info [here](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Features#push-campaigntowers-only).

## Quickstart

We've created a wiki article explaining how to get started, check it out [here](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Get-started).
