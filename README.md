> **A massive thank you to [@kevingrillet](https://github.com/kevingrillet) for basically doing all the work related to this new script version!** He's been incredibly useful and helpful, as well as patient (opened PR on the 26th of April, that's over 4 Months ago). His PR has the same amount of changes that the whole script had since I started it, that's how much work went into this! I seriously mean it when I say I cannot thank him enough for the amount of work and effort put into making the script that much better. Thank you very, very much Kevin.

## Description

This script is meant to automate the process of daily activities within the [AFK Arena](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilithgame.hgame.gp&hl=en_US) game. It uses [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to analyse pixel colors in screenshots and tap on the screen accordingly. If you like our work, please consider starring this repository (and joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Fq2cfqjp8D)) as it lets us know people use the script, which motivates us to keep working on it!

## Disclaimer

This is a very fragile script (it relies on pixel accuracy), which means the probability of encountering a new error every time a new patch rolls out by Lilith is pretty high. Keep an eye on the `Patch` badge to check the latest game version this script was tested on.

**We are not responsible for any type of ban or unintentional purchase! Use this script at your own risk.** We will do our best to try and make it as robust as possible.

## Quickstart

We've created a [Wiki](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki) with all the info you'd need to get started with this script. Head over there to [get started](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily/wiki/Get-started)!
